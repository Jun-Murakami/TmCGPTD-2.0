# TmCGPT Debugger
ChatGPT API Client Application.  
It supports Windows 10 and later, as well as MacOS.  
  
## Features:  
  
- **Vertical 5-split text editor**  
Designed to make it easy to cut and paste text to configure prompts.
- **Importing web service version logs**  
You can log in with your ChatGPT account and import logs from the web service version. Even if the chat log has reached its maximum length, you can continue the conversation semi-permanently after importing. (It has a feature that automatically compresses and retains old conversation history in the background.) Also, if you are a PLUS member, you can use the fast GPT3.5 model in the built-in browser as is.
- **Preset phrase function**  
You can register frequently used phrases, such as "Please translate ~ into English in several patterns," "You are a professional editor," and "Please summarize the following text in 300 characters or less," and insert them into the editor.
- **Text editor history**  
Automatically saves up to 200 entries of sent text history for reuse and tweaking of prompts.
- **API option settings**  
All API options for the Chat model can be adjusted via the GUI.

I only have an old Mac, so I haven't been able to test it on newer Macs, like the Silicon Mac. I would appreciate it if you could let me know if there are any issues.
